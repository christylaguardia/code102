*Christy's Notes Tue Jan 24*

**SSH Keys**
use to store git hub repo pswd, so don't have to do it everytime

the ssh folder is hidden
Users/christinelaguardia/.ssh/id_rsa

setup
get key and put in git
get the key url in git
then make relationship to local git repo

**Git Branches**
branch is a series of commits

do this to make new branch and checkout
git checkout -b feature/tuesday

**JavaScript**
var MyString = "anything";
; is the indicator to complier end of line
MyString = "42",
MyArray = '[1,2,3]'

REPL
Read
Evaluate
Print
Loop

variable are containers, like boxes
strings are literal text, like a lego
put the toy in the box, not box in the toy

'' vs "" is more about style

in JavaScript use ''
in html use ""

number + number = add together
number + numberString = concantinate

number == numberString  comparison but not strict
number = numberString  assignment
number === numberString  comparison strict

if (number === numberString) { ...}  this will be true or false
if (number = numberString) { ...}  this will be true
